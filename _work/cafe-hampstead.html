    Cafe Hampstead served modern middle eastern cuisine in the heart of Hampstead Heath, North London. They were
    looking for help to develop their tone of voice and digital identity through branded visual assets both for
    website and social media.
</p>

<p>
    The goal was to generate more awareness around Cafe Hampstead's complex menu and to create a strong digital
    identity which reflected the interiors and personality of the restaurant owner.
</p>

<p>
    I worked with them to produce a mixture of typographical and visual assets, which could be shared across all
    digital platforms to encourage north London diners to experience Cafe Hampstead's offering.
</p>

<p>
    By touching upon the heritage of the area, we used quotes by famous local authors to inspire a sense of romance
    and deep connection to the surrounding area.
